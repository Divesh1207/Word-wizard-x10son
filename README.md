## Why I Created WordWizard?????

During college, my friend Akram often found himself pausing to look up unfamiliar words while reading. It interrupted his focus and slowed him down.

He said, “There has to be a better way to get definitions quickly.” That’s how the idea for WordWizard came about. I wanted to create a tool that would provide instant meanings without breaking the reading flow.

So, I developed WordWizard to solve this exact problem. It’s designed to make your reading experience smoother and more efficient. I hope it proves as helpful to you as I wished it could have been for Akram.

P.S. Credit goes to Akram for inspiring this tool!
